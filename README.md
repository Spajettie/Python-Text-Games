# Spajettie's Python text games!
Here is the repository where I post all of my python text games.

They are free to play. All you need is the latest version of python which can be found here: https://www.python.org/downloads/

They are also under the MIT license, which means that you can use, edit, copy, etc. them however you want as long as you credit me.
